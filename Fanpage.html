    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, professionally known as Logic/Young Sinatra, was raised in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Logic released his first mixtape in 2009 titled <i>Logic: The Mixtape</i> and another the following year titled <i>Young, Broke, & Infamous</i>.
    He signed with Visionary Music Group shortly thereafter. His fourth mixtape, <i>Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever</i> debuted in 2013. This mixtape ultimately resulted in Logic signing with Def Jam Recordings.
    His 2017 album <i>Everybody</i> etched his claim to fame in stone on an international level. This was his first certified platinum album boasting the top-ten international hit "1-800-273-8255". That said, his platinum album deviated stylistically from the raw lyricism used to secure his initial fan base. This was rectified upon the release of 
    his 2018 album <i>YSIV (Young Sinatra IV)</i> in which he returned to his lyricist roots. In addition to being a talented artist, Logic is also an accomplished author, having two published novels under his belt.</p>
